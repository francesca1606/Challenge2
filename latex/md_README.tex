This program allows the user to work with sparse matrices stored in a compressed or uncompressed fashion, with row-\/wise or column-\/wise ordering. ~\newline
 A compressed sparse matrix consists of 3 vectors\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item m\+\_\+inner\+: if the storage ordering is row-\/wise, the vector stores the increase of non-\/zero elements from one row to the next; if it\textquotesingle{}s column-\/wise, it stores the increase of non-\/zero elements from one column to the next;
\item m\+\_\+outer\+: if the storage ordering is row-\/wise, the vector stores the column index of the non-\/zero elements, otheriwse it stores the row index of the non-\/zero elements;
\item m\+\_\+values\+: stores the values of the non-\/zero elements, following row-\/wise or column-\/wise ordering. An uncompressed sparse matrix consists of an ordered map\+:
\item key = array\mbox{[}row,column\mbox{]} of the non-\/zero element
\item value = value of the non-\/zero element
\end{DoxyItemize}

The file is divided into \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item main.\+cpp
\item include
\item Insp\+\_\+131.\+mtx
\item Makefile
\item README
\item LICENSE
\item .gitignore ~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}

~\newline
~\newline
 The include folder contains\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Sparse\+Matrix.\+hpp, where inside the namespace algebra the Sparse\+Matrix template class is declared, along with the enumerator Storage\+Order and the functor Is\+Row\+Wise
\item Sparse\+Matrix\+Impl.\+hpp, which contains the definitions of Sparse\+Matrix\textquotesingle{} methods and of the stream operator and the matrix-\/vector product (class\textquotesingle{} friends). ~\newline
 The overloading of operator$\ast$ that allows the product between a matrix and a vector is adapetd to work also for a matrix of one column with a vector of compatible dimension; the result will be a vector of dimension one.
\item read\+Matrix\+Market.\+hpp, which contains the definition of the friend method for reading the matrix from Insp\+\_\+131.\+mtx (Matrix\+Market format)
\end{DoxyItemize}

 The main.\+cpp file includes chrono.\+hpp, that is needed to time the execution of the matrix-\/product vector. To make the program include it, in the CPPFLAGS of the Makefile I employed the environmental variable PACS\+\_\+\+ROOT, which stands for the directory to pacs-\/examples/\+Examples ~\newline
~\newline
 To run the code, simply run make in the terminal. ~\newline
 If you want to remove the object file and the executable, run make clean \begin{DoxyVerb}      make; ./main; make clean
\end{DoxyVerb}
